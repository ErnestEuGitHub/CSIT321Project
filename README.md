The platform includes the following features and functions:
1. Organisers can select the sport they want to plan a league or tournament for, and then choose from a variety of popular match formats. The platform will generate the bracket/table for organiser to input seeding, schedules, scores and venues. After entering match results and team/player performance, the stepladders and ranking of the table will be updated.

2. Organisers can also create their own custom competition format and save the customised format for future use.

3. Support multi-user collaboration to update the same event/tournament, The initiator of a league or tournament can invite other users to collaborate on the event. This can be helpful for entering player information and updating match results. 

4. Provide news report: 
The platform provides a function for event coordinators to edit and publish news about players and matches, which include but are not limited to text, image, audio, video, etc. The news can be shared on social media to a broader community.
